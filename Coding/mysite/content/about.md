My name is Andy, how may I take your order? 

I am a full-stack engineer, born in raised in Los Angeles and residing in Seattle. I love gorging myself on everything from sushi to sourdough, trying my hand at different sports (earlier this year was badminton and bouldering, but I've since gotten back on the saddle and started cycling again), and cheering on my hometown Los Angeles Dodgers. 

After getting my degree in Political Economy from UC Berkeley in 2017, I moved up to Seattle and (perhaps inevitably) was sucked into the tech bubble. I decided to leave my experiences in finance and accounting behind and make a move into software engineering after a friend dropped me a coding challenge for funsies and I found myself captivated. I had the privilege of being accepted into Hack Reactor's Software Engineering Immersive program, where I was able to hone my techincal knowledge and work on some projects with some gifted and passionate individuals. 

Now I am on the hunt to find the right pair of shoes that will let me take the next big step down this new path. If you have any questions, suggestions, or simply some recommendations on some food gems (geographic location is irrelevant), smash that Contact Me button. Enjoy your stay; peace, love, and chicken nuggets.
